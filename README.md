  ```
  dependencies {
      implementation 'com.github.simformsolutions:SSComposeShowCaseView:1.0'
  }
  ```
  
## ü§î How to use it

* Composable function which is used to start showcase view
  ```kotlin
     fun ShowCaseTarget(
       targets: SnapshotStateMap<String, ShowcaseProperty>,
       isEnableAutoShowCase: Boolean = false,
       showcaseDelay: Long = 2000,
       key: String,
       onShowCaseCompleted: () -> Unit
     )
  ```

* Customise your showcase view using this data class
  ```kotlin
     data class ShowcaseProperty(
       val index: Int,
       val coordinates: LayoutCoordinates,
       val title: String,
       val titleColor: Color = Color.White,
       val subTitle: String,
       val subTitleColor: Color = Color.White,
       val showCaseType: ShowcaseType = ShowcaseType.SIMPLE_ROUNDED,
       val blurOpacity: Float = 0.8f
     )
  ```

* To start showcase view call composable function `ShowCaseTarget` like below
  ```kotlin
     val targets = remember { mutableStateMapOf<String, ShowcaseProperty>() }
     ShowCaseTarget(targets = targets, isEnableAutoShowCase = true, key = "Dashboard") {
        CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Main).launch {
            Toast.makeText(context, "Thank you! Intro Completed", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
        }
     }
  ```

* On which ever component you need to showcase, take coordinates of that component using
  Modifier.onGloballyPositioned and use ShowcaseProperty like shown below
  ```kotlin
       Image(
            imageVector = Icons.Default.MoreVert,
            contentDescription = "More icon",
            modifier = Modifier
                .padding(10.dp)
                .onGloballyPositioned {
                    target["more"] = ShowcaseProperty(
                        index = 1,
                        coordinates = it,
                        title = "More options",
                        subTitle = "Click here to see options",
                        showCaseType = ShowcaseType.ANIMATED_RECTANGLE
                    )
                }
        )
  ```
